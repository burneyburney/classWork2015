cout
cin <<--
	standard input object
	like count, requires iostream file
	used to read input from keyboard
	cin >> 
	input stored in variable

<iostream> has code for cout and cin 
(thats why we use it)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#include <iostream
using namespace std;

int main()
	int length, width, area;

	cout << "This program calculates the area of a ";
	cout << "rectangle.\n";
	cout << "what is the length of the rectangle? ";
	cin >> length;
	cout << "what is the width of the rectangle? ";
	cin >> width;
	area = length * width;
	cout << "the are of the rectangele is " << area << 

	etc....
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
alwayss use cout to display a prompt before each cin statmeent
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


cout <<"how tall is the room? ";
	cin >> height;

parenthesis override all mathemetical solutions 
	-- otherwise (PEMDAS)

there is no mathematical operation for exponents 
	Area=s^2 is written as Area = pow(s, 2);



TYPE CONVERSION
	operations are performed between operands of the sam type
	if not the same type, C++ will convert one to be the type of the other
	This can impact the results of calculations


5/3 = 1 
5/3.0 = normal



*TYPE CASTING IN PROGRAM 3-9*
-----------------------------------------------
sum = sum + 1;

is equivalent to 

sum += 1;
------------------------------------------------


*Stream manipulators*

Intro to loops: The while Loop
	loop- a control structure that causes a statement oor statements to repeat
General format of the while loop:
	while (expression)
	statement;
expression is evaluated
	if true then statement is executed, and expression is evaluated again
	if false, then the loop is finished and program statements following statement execute

the while loop in program 5-3
	
counter - a variable that is incremented or decremented each timea a loop repeats
can be used to control execution of the loop aka loop control variable
must be initialized before entering  loop

LOOPS-
while
do-while
for

****give a while loop, and write a corresponding for loop***

for(initialization; test; update)
	statement; // or block in {}

number=1
while(number <=3)
	cout << "Hello";
	number++;
	and while

for(number=1; number<=3; number++)
	cout << "Hello" << endl;
//end for

for(set; parameters; incriment)
	cout <<"say this while true" << endl;


Sentinels
	sentinel: a value in a list of values that indicates end of data

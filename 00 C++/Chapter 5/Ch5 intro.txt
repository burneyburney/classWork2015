files for data storage
	can use files insead of a keyboard, monitor screen for program 	input, output
	Allows data to be retained between program runs
	Steps: 
		Open the file
		Use the file(read from, write to, or both)
		Close the file
*Read FROM
*write TO

Files: What is Needed
	Use fstream header file for file access
File stream types:
	ifstream for input from a file
	ofstream for output to a file
	fstream  input from or output to a file

Define file stream objects:
	ifstream infile;
	ofstream outfile;

Opening Files
	Create a link between file name (outside program)
	and file strema object (inside program)
Use theopen member function:
	infile.open("inventory.dat");
	^ name of file in program
	outfile.open("report.txt");
Filename may include drive, path info.
Output file will be created if necessary; existing filew ill be erased first
Input file must exist for open to work

Testing for file open errors

Usin files:
Can use output file objett and << to send data to a file:
	outfile <<"Inventory report";
Can use input file objects and >> to copy data from file to variables:
	infile >> partNum;
	infile >> qtyInStock >>
	qtyOnOrder;

Using Loops to process Files
The stream extraction operator >> returns true when a value was 	successfully read, false otherwise
Can be tested in a while loop to continue execution as long as values are read fromt he file:
	while (inputFile >> number) ...

Closing Files
	use the close member function:
	infile.close();
	outfile.close();

Don't wait for operating system to close files at program end. 
	may be limit number of open files
	may be buffered output data waiting to send to file

		<h3>A Two-dimensional Array in Program 7-21</h3>
		<br>	
		look @ 7-21 program
		<br>
		<mark>*remember running total in C++</mark>
		<br>
	</p>

	<p>
		<h3>2D Array Initilization</h3>
		<br>
		Two dimensional arrays are intilized row-by-row
		Can omit inner {} some initial values in a row - array element s without initial 			values will be set to 0 or <mark>NULL </mark> 
		<br>
	</p>

	<p>
		Use array name as argument in function call <br>
		 getExams...
		<br> <br>
		
		<h3>Example - The showArray Functrion from Program 7-22</h3>
		<h3>HOW <mark>showArray</mark> is Called </h3> <Br>
		in call you dont put any square brackets.. just the name
		<bR>
		<br>
		<h3>Summing All the Elements in a Two-Dimensional Array</h3>
		<br>				
	</p>
	<p>
		What if i want a total of 1 row?? <br>
		What if i want to total for colomns?	<br>
		use a <mark>for</mark> loop <br> <br>
		
		<h3>Summing the Rows of a Two-Dimensional Array</h3> <br>
		
&nbsp			// Set the accumulator
&nbsp			total =0;
&nbsp			// Sum a row.
&nbsp			for (int col = 0; col < NUM_SCORES; col++)
&nbsp			total += scores[row][col];
&nbsp			// Get the average
&nbsp			average = total / NUM_SCORES;
&nbsp			//Display the average.
&nbsp			cout << "Score average for student "
&nbsp			<< (row + 1 << " is " << average << endl;

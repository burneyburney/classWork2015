ch 7 arrays

C++ 

7.1
	Arrys hold multiple values

Array - variable that can store multiple values of the same type
values are stored in adjacent memory locations
Declared using [] operator:
	int tests[5];

[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]

int = data type of the array elements
tests = is the name of the array
The size of an array is:
	the total number of byts occupied
	(# of elements) * (# of bytes for each element)
Examples:
	int tess[5] ...

		SIZE DECLARATORS
const int SIZE = 5;
int tests[SIZE];

subscripts start at 0
[0][1][2][3][4][5]
subscript = SIZE - 1

tests[0] = 79;
cout << tests[0];
cin >> tests[1];
tests[4] = tests[0] + tests[1]


cout << tests; // not legal

7-1

using a loop to step through an array

7.3 
no bounds checking in C++

When you use a value as an array subscript, C++ does not check it to make sure it is a valid subscript

begin subscript with 0

const int SIZE = 5;
int tests[SIZE] = {79,92,...};
